        This is an invisible layer that sits on top of EVERYTHING.
        It creates those subtle horizontal lines you see on old CRT
        monitors and in movies like The Matrix. It's purely decorative —
        it doesn't hold any content, just vibes.

        This is the main attraction! A grid of photos with that
        neon Tron-style border. Each photo is wrapped in a container
        (gallery-item) so we can style and animate them individually.

        RIGHT NOW these use placeholder images. We'll swap them
        for your real photos later!
