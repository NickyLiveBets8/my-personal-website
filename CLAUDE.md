# CLAUDE.md - Project Guidelines

## About the User

- **Non-technical user** who doesn't know how to code
- Needs **step-by-step instructions** for any tasks requiring user action (e.g., getting API keys)
- Assume no prior technical knowledge

## How to Communicate

- **Explain everything in plain language** - no unexplained jargon
- Use **metaphors and analogies** to make technical concepts understandable
- Act as both **engineer and teacher** - explain what you're doing and why
- Help debug by explaining the "why" behind issues so the user can spot logic errors

## Code Standards

- Add **detailed comments in plain English** to all generated code
- Comments should explain the purpose and logic, not just what the code does

## Workflow Preferences

- **Execute all commands** - don't just show them, run them
- **Open previews automatically** (links, files, etc.) whenever available
- Use **AskUserQuestion liberally** to clarify requirements - when in doubt, ask
- At project start, **research and evaluate architectural options** with pros/cons in plain language before proceeding

## Documentation Requirements

- Create a **LEARN.md** file for every project that includes:
  - Technical architecture explained in plain language
  - Codebase structure and how parts connect
  - Technologies used and why we chose them
  - Lessons learned (bugs encountered, how we fixed them, pitfalls to avoid)
  - Best practices and how good engineers think
  - Written in an **engaging, accessible style** - not boring technical docs
  - Use analogies and anecdotes to make it memorable

## Project Details

- **Project Type:** My Personal Website
- **Tech Stack:** HTML, Practice Pushing Gits
- **Main Features:** Static to start
